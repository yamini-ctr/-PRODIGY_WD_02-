Pixel Manipulation for Encryption and Decryption
Encryption Process
Image Preparation: Choose a cover image and load it into memory.
Data Conversion: Convert the data you want to encrypt (text, binary, etc.) into a binary format.
Key Generation: Create a key for encryption. This could be a password or a randomly generated sequence.
Embed Data:
Modify pixel values based on the binary data and the key.
This can be done using techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation, where you alter the least significant bits of pixel values to encode the binary data.
Save Encrypted Image: Save the modified image as the encrypted output.
Decryption Process
Load Encrypted Image: Load the encrypted image.
Extract Data: Reverse the pixel manipulation to extract the binary data using the same key.
Data Conversion: Convert the binary data back into its original format.

Password Strength Considerations
Length: A longer password is generally stronger because it increases the number of possible combinations.
Complexity: Include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Uniqueness: Avoid common words, phrases, or easily guessable patterns.
Storage: Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms and never hard-code them directly into your scripts.
Example of a Strong Password:

Length: At least 12 characters
Complexity: P@ssw0rd!2#4Q
Tips for Implementation
Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling for file operations and data conversions.
Security: Consider more advanced techniques for real-world applications, such as cryptographic libraries and stronger encryption algorithms.
Performance: Large images and long data may require optimization for performance.
